UX flow:

2. Validate email input and enable submit button accordingly.
3. Implementing login with google is a plus.


Page 2:

4. When checkbox is checked and OTP input is valid, Submit button should be enabled.
5. Notification mentioned on third page should be shown to user for 3 seconds as a banner and "signing..." should then be changed in "signed".
